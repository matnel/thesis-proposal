Based on the extensive research it is not clear weather the Internet supports deliberative democracy or not.

\section{Research questions}

This research proposal aims to study the impact design decisions have on participation. The suggestion is that certain decisions, such as anonymity and choices on moderation affect quality of deliberation. Previous research in this domain is narrow and does not have a strong empirical focus. \citeasnoun{fatland07} has designed a new interface for political participation, but it has not been evaluated in practice. \citeasnoun{wright07}

\possessivecite{smith09} work on assessment of deliberative practices suggests, among others that the both the quality of the discussion and diversity of participants should be evaluated. The quality of the discussion points to the area

\section{Approach}

Use of field experimentation is required ...

For measuring the deliberative qualities of the discussion, one potential approach is to apply \possessivecite{steenbergen03} Discourse Quality Index (DQI).
